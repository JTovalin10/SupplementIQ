# SupplementIQ - TODO Checklist
## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues (Still Need Attention)

### 1. Product Submission & Approval Process
- **Issue**: No functional add new product and approval workflow
- **Impact**: Core feature not implemented
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY

### 2. Product Configuration System Migration
- **Issue**: Moving ingredient dosage data from code to database
- **Impact**: Better scalability and admin management
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Details**: 
  - Create product_configurations table in database
  - Store ingredient dosages, cautions, and scientific citations in DB
  - Update dosage calculator to use database data
  - Maintain TypeScript interfaces for type safety

## ðŸ”§ Technical Debt

### 2. Debug Logs Cleanup
- **Issue**: Debug console logs still present in production code
- **Location**: `src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ LOW PRIORITY

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Complete Product Submission & Approval Process**: Create functional add new product and approval workflow
