# SupplementIQ - TODO Checklist
## üö® Critical Issues (Still Need Attention)

### 1. Product Submission & Approval Process
- **Issue**: No functional add new product and approval workflow
- **Impact**: Core feature not implemented
- **Status**: üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY

### 2. Product Configuration System Migration
- **Issue**: Moving ingredient dosage data from code to database
- **Impact**: Better scalability and admin management
- **Status**: üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Details**: 
  - Create product_configurations table in database
  - Store ingredient dosages, cautions, and scientific citations in DB
  - Update dosage calculator to use database data
  - Maintain TypeScript interfaces for type safety

## üîß Technical Debt

### 2. Debug Logs Cleanup
- **Issue**: Debug console logs still present in production code
- **Location**: `src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Status**: üü° LOW PRIORITY

## üéØ Priority Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Complete Product Submission & Approval Process**: Create functional add new product and approval workflow
   - Build product submission form for users
   - Create admin approval interface
   - Implement approval/rejection workflow
   - Add email notifications for status changes
   - **Status**: üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY

### Medium Priority
2. **Test All User Routes**: Verify `/user/dashboard`, `/user/profile` work correctly
3. **Implement Redis Caching**: Set up Redis server for production caching
4. **Add Error Boundaries**: Better error handling for auth failures

### Low Priority
5. **Clean Up Debug Logs**: Remove console.log statements from production code
6. **Improve Loading States**: Better UX during auth checks
7. **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting
8. **Add Monitoring**: Implement error tracking and performance monitoring

## üîç Debugging Notes

### Auth Flow Issues
- ~~Login API returns 200 but session doesn't persist~~ ‚úÖ FIXED
- User profile fetch may be failing silently
- Role detection logic needs investigation
- Supabase client configuration may need adjustment

### Architecture Clarification
- **Current**: Single Next.js app with API routes
- **Documented**: Single Next.js app (updated)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ~~Fix session persistence in AuthContext~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
2. ~~Remove unused JWT utilities~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
3. ~~Complete Context Migration~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
4. ~~Consolidate UserContext into AuthContext~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
5. ~~Consolidate AdminContext into AuthContext~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
6. Test authentication flow end-to-end
7. Focus on product submission workflow

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Complete product submission workflow
2. Test all user routes and admin functions
3. Set up Redis caching for production
4. Clean up debug logs and console statements

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. Add comprehensive error handling
2. Implement monitoring and analytics
3. Add automated testing
4. Performance optimization and caching

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [x] Users can log in and stay logged in across page refreshes ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] JWT tokens are properly generated and validated ‚úÖ COMPLETED (using Supabase Auth)
- [ ] Product submission workflow is fully functional
- [ ] Admin approval process works correctly
- [ ] All user routes are tested and working
- [x] Documentation matches actual implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [ ] No debug logs in production code
- [ ] Redis caching is implemented and working
